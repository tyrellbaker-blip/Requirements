    <h2> Section 1: Overview</h2>
</div>

<p>
    PawsConnect is a social media application that will allow users to create profiles for both themselves and the pets they own. Much like Facebook, users will be able to add
    'friends' for themselves and their pets. Users will be able to find one another and other pets via a search function, and will be able to view their relationships via a
    connections graph.

        <h2>Section 2: Database Representation</h2>
        <p>
            The database employed will be a version of SQLite that runs atop the Django framework. The following information describes the entities that should be present in the
            database, their attributes, and their relationships for clarity.
        </p>
        <br>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Entities and Attributes</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>User Attributes:</strong> ID (PK), First Name, Last Name, Email Address, Phone Number, City, State, ZIP
                        <ul>
                            <li>Note: City, State, ZIP, and Passwords are stored in a secure manner, potentially in a separate entity or securely hashed within the User entity.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Authentication</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Attributes: User ID (FK), Hashed Password</li>
                            <li>Note: This entity ensures that sensitive authentication details are stored separately for enhanced security.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Pet Attributes:</strong> ID (PK), Name, Type (e.g., Cat, Dog, Lizard), Size (Small, Medium, Large), Owner ID (FK)</li>
                    <li><strong>Post</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Attributes: ID (PK), Content, UserID (FK, nullable), PetID (FK, nullable)</li>
                            <li>Note: A Post can be linked to either a User or a Pet, allowing for posts to be attributed correctly.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Profile Picture</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Attributes: ID (PK), Image URL, UserID (FK, nullable), PetID (FK, nullable)</li>
                            <li>Note: Similar to Post, a Profile Picture can be associated with either a User or a Pet.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Friendship</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Attributes: UserID1 (FK), UserID2 (FK)</li>
                            <li>Note: This entity represents the bidirectional friendship between users.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Pet Friends</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Attributes: PetID1 (FK), PetID2 (FK)</li>
                            <li>Note: This entity represents friendships or connections between pets, which can be independent of their owners.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Relationships and Cardinalities</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>User to Authentication: One-to-One. Each User has one set of authentication credentials.</li>
                    <li>User to Pet: One-to-Many. A User can own multiple Pets, but each Pet has exactly one Owner.</li>
                    <li>User to Post: One-to-Many. Users can make multiple Posts, but each Post is made by one User.</li>
                    <li>Pet to Post: One-to-Many. Pets can be attributed multiple Posts, but each Post is attributed to one Pet.</li>
                    <li>User to Profile Picture: One-to-One. Each User can have one Profile Picture.</li>
                    <li>Pet to Profile Picture: One-to-One. Each Pet can have one Profile Picture.</li>
                    <li>User to User (Friendship): Many-to-Many. Users can have multiple friends.</li>
                    <li>Pet to Pet (Pet Friends): Many-to-Many. Pets can have multiple pet friends.</li>
                    <li>User to Pet (Friendship): Many-to-Many. Users can add pets as friends independently of the pet's owner.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>

<h2> Section 3: Functionality for Users</h2>
<ol>
    <li>
        <strong> Create Account</strong>
        <ul>
         <li> This functionality allows users to create a username and password. This should also be the first place where the user can add their pet and pet photographs
            to the
            database, thereby creating a pet profile. Adding a pet should not be a requirement, because we will assume that people without pets but are looking to adopt can do
            so by connecting with someone looking to put an animal up for adoption.
