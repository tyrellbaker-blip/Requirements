    <h3> Requirements Specification </h3>
    <h4>Authors: Ty Baker, Brandon Grimaldo, Daniel Rodas, Smirth Luciano Salinas</h4>
</div>
<hr class="bold">
<div class="text-center mx-3">
    <h2> Section 1: Overview</h2>
</div>
<div>
    <p class="mx-3">
        PawsConnect is a social media app that will allow pet owners, prospective pet owners, and pets to create and
        maintain linked relationships, called "friendships." For brevity, in the document, we will refer to entities as
        follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Human User: USER</li>
        <li>Animal: PET</li>
        <li>Database: DB</li>
        <li>Human Friendship Connection: HFR</li>
        <li>Human-Pet Friendship Connection: HPF</li>
        <li>Pet-Pet Friendship Connection: PPF</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="mx-3">
        A brief DB description is contained in the section that follows, representing the Key relationships
        necessary for the maintenance of the friendship structure using a relational DB, along with a more
        thorough description of the architecture necessary for functionality.
    </p>
    <p class="mx-3">
        The information needed by BD should be collected upon navigation to the web application's home page. From
        there, users should have the option to log in or sign up. The sign up form should collect user information
        and feed it to DB, ensuring that information that must be kept private is stored separately via
        authentication protocol. Django provides the framework to accomplish this.
    </p>
    <p class="mx-3">
        On an aggregate scale, PawsConnect is a social media application for people with animals. Users of the
        application should be able to create profiles for themselves and their animals, update and edit these
        profiles, and connect with other users. Support for traditional social media application activities such as
        uploading and updating profile pictures for USER and PET must be included, along with the ability to create
        and edit posts on a common feed that updates dynamically. However, PawsConnect will NOT
        contain a messaging functionality. In order to connect with other users, PawsConnect must support filtered
        searching with the following parameters:
    <ul>
        <li>USER Name</li>
        <li>PET Name</li>
        <li>Type of Pet</li>
        <li>Pet Size</li>
        <li>Location
            <ul>
                <li class="text-dark italicize">City</li>
                <li class="text-dark italicize">State</li>
                <li class="text-dark italicize"> A 'within x miles' feature would be useful</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Age</li>
        <li>Breed</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<p class="mx-3"> USER should be able to vizualize their connection with other users via a
    'my-connections' feature that will return a graphical representation of all HFR connections for the specific
    USER. USER should be able to change the language their newsfeed appears in at will.
</p>

    <h2>Section 2: Database Representation</h2>
    <p class="mx-3">
        The database supports the pet social media app, featuring a connection graph that visually represents the
        connections between users and their pets. Users can filter to view either their own connections or those of any
        of their pets. The following entities, attributes, and relationships are crucial for this functionality.
    </p>
    <div class="table-container">

    <h2>Section 3: Functionality for User </h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong> Create User Profile </strong>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    USER should be able to navigate to a login page where their information is collected via an HTML
                    form and stored in the database for retrieval and authentication.
                </li>
                <li>
                    NAME, EMAIL, LOCATION, and PASSWORD are not optional. Adding a pet at this stage should be optional,
                    as people
                    looking to adopt should be able to sign up as well.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If USER does have an animal, USER must submit
                    information about the animal: name, age, type, breed. This information should be stored in the
                    database
                    as its own entity, generating a new PET in the database and storing USERID of the USER as its
                    foreignkey
                    to establish ownership of the animal.
                </li>

            </ul>
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Create Pet Profile</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>USER should be able to, separately from the sign-in process, add a PET to the account at any
                    point.
                </li>
                <li>No matter when PET is added, the information collected should be the same -- name, age, breed
                    and an optional photo. PET should be linked to the USERID of USER.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Create Posts(Owner)</strong>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Posts for both USER and PET should support displaying both text and photographs.
                </li>
                <li>A common feed should exist that makes it possible for users to post on a forum.
                </li>
                <li>
                    This should be done using Django's syndication-feed-generating framework, which will take care of
                    heavy-load issues under
                    the hood like dynamic updating, post editability, and database attribution.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Posts should be structured such that USER can write and edit the post if they choose.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Create Posts(Pet)</strong>
            <ul>

                <li>
                    USER should be able to make posts on behalf of any PET associated with their unique USERID.
                </li>
                <li>
                    These posts should be maintained by PET in the database, but accessible via USER.
                </li>


            </ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Change Languages</strong>
            <p>
                USER should have the option to update the language their feed appears in. In order to accomplish this,
                use Azure AI's Translator API. The API needs to be able to access the posts of USER to update the
                displayed language.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Search</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    USER should be able to search for any other USER by filtering for name, location, or type of
                    animal owned
                </li>

                <li>
                    USER should be able to search for PET by name, breed, age group, or location.
                </li>


            </ul>

        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Connection Graph</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    USER should be able to visualize a node-based graphical representation of their connections to
                    owners and pets.
                </li>

                <li>
                    USER should be able to filter and decide whether they want to see USER to USER, USER to PET, or
                    USER and PET connection
                </li>
                <li> The visualization of the Connection Graph will use the APEX Graph Visualization API, which
                    will allow visualization of SQL queries. Therefore, FRIENDSHIP within DB should be queried,
                    returning all friendships associated with the given USER api. Only one Connection Graph can be
                    visualized at once, meaning USER should not be able to be shown the unique Connection Graph for
                    themselves and any of their associated PET objects at once. USER should, however, be able to select
                    between themselves and any associated PET objects and be returned a connection graph.
                </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Security</strong>
                <ul>
                    User password and location information should be securely stored in the database. The bulk of
                    this will be ensured by the Django framework.

            <li>
                <strong>Ease of Use/Robustness</strong>
                <ul>
                    Going from section to section of the application should be seamless, and the functionality for
                    dynamic refreshing of the user feed needs to be smooth -- the user experience should not be
                    hindered by a refreshing process.

                        PawsConnect is a web based application, which means it will need to be hosted on a server.
                        Django provides a framework for server setup.
