    <h2> Section 1: Overview</h2>
</div>
<div>
    <p class="mx-3">
        PawsConnect is a social media app that will allow pet owners, prospective pet owners, and pets to create and
        maintain linked relationships, called "friendships." For brevity, in the document, we will refer to entities as
        follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Human User: USER</li>
        <li>Animal: PET</li>
        <li>Database: DB</li>
        <li>Human Friendship Connection: HFR</li>
        <li>Human-Pet Friendship Connection: HPF</li>
        <li>Pet-Pet Friendship Connection: PPF</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="mx-3">
        A brief DB description is contained in the section that follows, representing the Key relationships
        necessary for the maintenance of the friendship structure using a relational DB, along with a more
        thorough description of the architecture necessary for functionality.
    </p>
    <p class="mx-3">
        On an aggregate scale, PawsConnect is a social media application for people with animals. Users of the
        application should be able to create profiles for themselves and their animals, update and edit these
        profiles, and connect with other users. Support for traditional social media application activities such as
        uploading and updating profile pictures for USER and PET must be included, along with the ability to create
        and edit posts on a common feed that updates dynamically. However, PawsConnect will NOT
        contain a messaging functionality.  In order to connect with other users, PawsConnect must support filtered
        searching with the following parameters:
    <ul>
        <li>USER Name</li>
        <li>PET Name</li>
        <li>Type of Pet</li>
        <li>Pet Size</li>
    <li>Location
        <ul>
            <li class="text-dark italicize">City</li>
            <li class="text-dark italicize">State</li>
            <li class="text-dark italicize"> A 'within x miles' feature would be useful</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Age</li>
    <li>Breed</li>
    </ul>
</div>
    <p class="mx-3"> USER should be able to vizualize their connection with other users via a
        'my-connections' feature that will return a graphical representation of all HFR connections for the specific
        USER. USER should be able to change the language their newsfeed appears in at will.

    <h2>Section 2: Database Representation</h2>
    <p class="mx-3">
        The database employed will be a version of SQLite that runs atop the Django framework. The following information
        describes the entities that should be present in the database, their attributes, and their relationships for clarity.

    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong> Create User Profile </strong>
            <ul>
                USER should be able to navigate to a login page where their information is collected via an HTML
                form and stored in the database for retrieval and authentication with an HTML form. NAME, EMAIL,
                LOCATION, and PASSWORD are not optional. Adding a pet at this stage should be optional, as people
                looking to adopt should be able to sign up as well. If USER does have an animal, USER must submit
                information about the animal: name, age, type, breed. This information should be stored in the database
                as its own entity, generating a new PET in the database and storing USERID of the USER as its foreignkey
                to establish ownership of the animal.
            </ul>
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Create Pet Profile</strong>
            <ul>USER should be able to, separately from the sign-in process, add a pet to their account at any
                point. Users should also be able to edit the name of their existing pets in the database, but not
                alter their petID. This should be done via a separate HTML form using Django's framework.
            </ul>
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Create Posts(Owner)</strong>
            <ul>
                A common feed should exist that makes it possible for users to post on a forum. This should be done
                using Django's syndication-feed-generating framework, which will take care of heavy-load issues under
                the hood like dynamic updating, post editability, and database attribution.
            </ul>
            <ul>
                Posts should be structured such that USER can write and edit the
