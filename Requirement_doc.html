    <h2> Section 1: Overview</h2>
</div>

<p>
    PawsConnect is a social media application that will allow users to create profiles for both themselves and the pets
    they own. Much like Facebook, users will be able to add
    'friends' for themselves and their pets. Users will be able to find one another and other pets via a search
    function, and will be able to view their relationships via a
    connections graph.

    <h2>Section 2: Database Representation</h2>
    <p>
        The database employed will be a version of SQLite that runs atop the Django framework. The following information
        describes the entities that should be present in the
        database, their attributes, and their relationships for clarity.
    </p>
    <br>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Entities and Attributes</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>User Attributes:</strong> ID (PK), First Name, Last Name, Email Address, Phone Number, City,
                    State, ZIP
                    <ul>
                        <li>Note: City, State, ZIP, and Passwords are stored in a secure manner, potentially in a
                            separate entity or securely hashed within the User entity.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Authentication</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Attributes: User ID (FK), Hashed Password</li>
                        <li>Note: This entity ensures that sensitive authentication details are stored separately for
                            enhanced security.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Pet Attributes:</strong> ID (PK), Name, Type (e.g., Cat, Dog, Lizard), Size (Small, Medium,
                    Large), Owner ID (FK)
                </li>
                <li><strong>Post</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Attributes: ID (PK), Content, UserID (FK, nullable), PetID (FK, nullable)</li>
                        <li>Note: A Post can be linked to either a User or a Pet, allowing for posts to be attributed
                            correctly.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Profile Picture</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Attributes: ID (PK), Image URL, UserID (FK, nullable), PetID (FK, nullable)</li>
                        <li>Note: Similar to Post, a Profile Picture can be associated with either a User or a Pet.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Friendship</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Attributes: UserID1 (FK), UserID2 (FK)</li>
                        <li>Note: This entity represents the bidirectional friendship between users.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Pet Friends</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Attributes: PetID1 (FK), PetID2 (FK)</li>
                        <li>Note: This entity represents friendships or connections between pets, which can be
                            independent of their owners.
                        </li>

            <strong>Relationships and Cardinalities</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>User to Authentication: One-to-One. Each User has one set of authentication credentials.</li>
                <li>User to Pet: One-to-Many. A User can own multiple Pets, but each Pet has exactly one Owner.</li>
                <li>User to Post: One-to-Many. Users can make multiple Posts, but each Post is made by one User.</li>
                <li>Pet to Post: One-to-Many. Pets can be attributed multiple Posts, but each Post is attributed to one
                    Pet.
                </li>
                <li>User to Profile Picture: One-to-One. Each User can have one Profile Picture.</li>
                <li>Pet to Profile Picture: One-to-One. Each Pet can have one Profile Picture.</li>
                <li>User to User (Friendship): Many-to-Many. Users can have multiple friends.</li>
                <li>Pet to Pet (Pet Friends): Many-to-Many. Pets can have multiple pet friends.</li>
                <li>User to Pet (Friendship): Many-to-Many. Users can add pets as friends independently of the pet's
                    owner.

    <h2>Section 3: Functionality for User </h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong> Create User Profile </strong>
            <ul>
                USER should be able to navigate to a login page where their information is collected via an HTML
                form and stored in the database for retrieval and authentication with an HTML form. NAME, EMAIL,
                LOCATION, and PASSWORD are not optional. Adding a pet at this stage should be optional, as people
                looking to adopt should be able to sign up as well. If USER does have an animal, USER must submit
                information about the animal: name, age, type, breed. This information should be stored in the database
                as its own entity, generating a new PET in the database and storing USERID of the USER as its foreignkey
                to establish ownership of the animal.
            </ul>
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Create Pet Profile</strong>
            <ul>USER should be able to, separately from the sign-in process, add a pet to their account at any
                point. Users should also be able to edit the name of their existing pets in the database, but not
                alter their petID. This should be done via a separate HTML form using Django's framework.
            </ul>
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Create Posts(Owner)</strong>
            <ul>
                A common feed should exist that makes it possible for users to post on a forum. This should be done
                using Django's syndication-feed-generating framework, which will take care of heavy-load issues under
                the hood like dynamic updating, post editability, and database attribution.
            </ul>
            <ul>
                Posts should be structured such that USER can write and edit the
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
